GOALS

It is the goal of the Vista Unified School District to provide an opportunity for interested students to enroll in one of the District’s five magnet schools: Casita Center, Vista Academy of Visual and Performing Arts, Vista Magnet Middle School, Vista Innovation & Design Academy and Mission Vista High School.  Because space is limited at each school, the District strives to provide a clear, fair and balanced admissions procedure.  The District’s magnet schools accept students without regard to disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or English Language Learner status.  Both District students and students residing outside of the District will be considered for admission.

APPLICATION

On January 11, 2021, the Vista Unified School District will begin accepting applications for all students interested in enrollment.  The Vista Unified School District Magnet School Common Application (“Magnet Application”) must be completed and submitted online by February 19, 2021 at 4:30 p.m. in order to be considered for admission for the 2021-22 school year. Applications for siblings of current students will always be accepted. If, after the application deadline and admission, available spaces remain at individual sites, the application process may be re-opened for individual schools. Post-deadline applications will be accepted after the lottery and placed at the bottom of the waitlist in the order they are received. Applications for siblings of current students will always be given priority at the top of the waitlist. The Magnet Application form will be available online and online submission by parents/guardians is strongly preferred.  A paper-based application will also be available and parents/guardians who complete the paper-based form will be contacted by a VUSD employee who will work directly with them to complete an online application on their behalf.

Students interested in enrollment in the 2021-22 school year at a magnet school that they are not currently attending must complete a new application.  Applications and waitlist numbers from previous years are no longer valid.

Students under expulsion at the time of the lottery are ineligible for magnet school admissions.

SELECTION PROCESS

Continuing Enrollment

All students currently enrolled in a magnet school are encouraged to continue their attendance.    Continuing students are not required to complete a new application, however, to guarantee placement at Casita Center, Vista Academy, Vista Magnet Middle School and Vista Innovation and Design Academy, students must return their Participation Agreement Form to their school’s office during the spring as affirmation of their intent to continue their enrollment.  If the school does not receive a student’s Participation Agreement by the deadline, the District reserves the right to revoke that student’s enrollment. 

To guarantee placement at Mission Vista High School, students must complete the class registration process with their counselors by the spring deadline.  If a student does not complete this process by the deadline, the District reserves the right to revoke that student’s enrollment.

If a continuing student fails to comply with the terms of the Participation Agreement during the current year, the school site where they are attending retains the right to revoke the student’s continuing enrollment offer and decline to consider them for future enrollment.

PRIORITY ADMISSION

Priority status will be given to students who apply on or before the February 19, 2021 deadline and meet one of the following criteria (documentation may be required):

The student has a brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, step-brother, or step-sister living in the same household, who will be attending the magnet school to which the student is applying during the 2021-2022 school year;
The student’s parent/guardian or step-parent is a “permanent” employee of the District who is NOT in an “at-will”** or “exempt”** position;
The student is currently enrolled in the 5th or 8th grade level at another magnet school in the district;
Children of active duty military personnel;
Foster/Homeless Youth

** “At will” and “exempt” position employees include substitutes, temporary office workers, independent contractors, walk-on coaches, etc.

LOTTERY

The District will conduct an admissions lottery at the district office at a time and date chosen by the Superintendent or their designee.  After the priority admissions process (including a lottery, if required), a lottery for the remaining available spaces will be conducted.  Each lottery will be conducted using an electronic method selected by the District.  Employees from the District Student Support Services office will conduct and/or oversee the lotteries to ensure compliance with this magnet school admission procedure.

All students who reside in the VUSD attendance boundaries will be assigned to one of three pools based on the middle school attendance area in which they reside.  All Interdistrict transfer students will be assigned to an Out-of-District Pool.  Each pool will be randomly assigned a place in the drawing order (one through four).  The student drawing order within each pool will be randomly reassigned.

Students on an Interdistrict Transfer will be limited to 10% of the lottery.  If there are spaces available after the lottery, and all students within the VUSD boundaries are accepted, then students on Interdistrict Transfers may be accepted above the 10% limitation.

NOTE: The VUSD School Board reserves the right to adjust the percentage of inter-district transfer students who are accepted to magnet schools through the lottery process.

Students will be admitted in the order they are drawn from the lottery until all available spaces for that school and grade level are filled.  Any remaining students will be placed on a waitlist for their school and grade, in lottery order.  If the size of any waitlist grows so large that a student would have no reasonable chance of gaining admission, the waitlist will be closed and remaining students will be appropriately notified.

For the 2021-2022 school year, all school lotteries will take place the week of March 1, 2021.

NOTIFICATION

At the end of the lottery, the VUSD Student Support Services office will notify students (via mail, email and/or phone call) of any offer of admission or their placement on the school’s waitlist.

K-8 ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER OF ADMISSION

After the District extends an offer of admission to a student, the student may accept the offer by filling out a Participation Agreement Form. This form must be completed and submitted within three (3) working days of the notification of acceptance. If a student receives more than one offer, s/he may only accept one offer; once one magnet school offer is accepted, all other magnet school admission offers to that student will automatically be rescinded.  If a student does not complete and submit a Participation Agreement Form by the specified deadline, the offer of admission will automatically be rescinded.

HIGH SCHOOL ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER OF ADMISSION

After the lottery for acceptance is held, all applicants will be notified of their status (accepted or wait-listed) by mail, email and/or phone call.  Those students who are accepted and currently attend a VUSD school will be automatically enrolled at MVHS for the following school year.  All incoming students must complete the Participation Agreement form, which must be received by MVHS within three (3) working days of the offer of admission.  In addition, students who are not currently attending a VUSD school will have exactly three (3) weeks from the date of notice to submit all required paperwork (as specified in the letter they receive) to MVHS in order to secure their enrollment.  Out of district students who are accepted, but whose parents fail to submit the required paperwork within this three week period will automatically (and without additional notice) have their acceptance to MVHS revoked.  Their student’s space will be released to a student on the waitlist.  In the event that a parent is unable to submit paperwork within the three-week time period (e.g., the family currently resides outside of the local area), the parent may petition MVHS for an extension of the deadline to submit paperwork.  Petitions for extensions will be granted for good cause and must be submitted to MVHS before the end of the three-week period.

For students who are offered admission in July and August, MVHS is unable to guarantee course availability.  In some cases, it may be impossible for a late-accepted student to enroll due to a lack of space in required grade-level classes.  In these cases, a student’s acceptance may be revoked due to lack of space.

OFFERS TO WAITLIST APPLICANTS

After all of the available spaces are filled, a waitlist for each school and grade level will be created from the initial lottery.  As spaces become available, students will only be admitted from the waitlist, in the order they are assigned on the list.  Once a space becomes available, staff from the magnet school will contact students (via email and/or phone call) with an offer of admission.  Students admitted from the waitlist will have two (2) working days to accept an offer of admission by filling out and returning a Participation Agreement Form.  The Participation Agreement Form must be received by the magnet school site where the student is enrolling by the deadline.  Postmarks will not be accepted.

POST-DEADLINE APPLICATIONS

Applications may continue to be accepted after the February 19, 2021 deadline if a school has or anticipates having additional space available for students.  Students will be placed at the bottom of the existing waitlist.  Should an applicant meet one of the priority criteria, they will be given priority on the waitlist. Siblings of current students will always be placed at the top of the waitlist below any other siblings.

CLOSE OF ADMISSIONS PERIOD

At the end of the school day on Friday, September 3, 2021, the admissions period will close* and the waitlist will be terminated.   Mission Vista High School will not offer admission after the 10th day of the school year, Tuesday, August 31, 2021*.

*Any admission of a student after these dates will be at the discretion of the VUSD Student Support Services Department.
